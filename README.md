# Intervals
## Designed by [H. Phuong Nguyen](https://www.instagram.com/duo.xyz/)

Intervals is heavily inspired by the retro-futuristic aesthetics and the idea of space and robots in Lemâ€™s time. On the path to transform from a geometric font to a bitmap font, the variable font discovers many letterforms of unique energy.
